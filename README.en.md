## What is Voxelamming?

Voxelamming = Voxel + Programming

Voxelamming is a programming learning app utilizing ARKit. It can be used for free on ARKit-compatible iPhones and iPads (iOS 13 and above). You can have fun by arranging voxels (cubical equivalent to pixels in 3D space), programmed on a computer, in a virtual space.

## About Voxelamming Turtle Extension

The Voxelamming Turtle Extension was developed for younger children and programming beginners as a more intuitive introduction to programming and as an introduction to Voxelamming.

The Voxelamming Turtle Extension provides a graphic drawing tool called TurtleGraphics. Turtle Graphics assumes a physical "turtle" (a small robot with a pen).The turtle receives commands to move forward, backward, rotate left, rotate right, raise the pen, lower the pen, etc., and moves accordingly. The turtle draws lines where it moves while the pen is down. TurtleGraphics visualizes the turtle's movements by displaying the lines drawn by the turtle.
